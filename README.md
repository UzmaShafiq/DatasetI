# DatasetI
EMG dataset corresponding to 4 hand motions
The dataset comprises information gathered from ten healthy subjects utilizing four Delsys Trigno electrodes. The data was collected in two sessions for each subject. The dataset encompasses four distinct hand motionsâ€”hand open, hand close, hand extension, and hand flexion. The data was collected by placing electrodes on four muscles of the upper limb i.e. Flexor carpi ulnaris, Palmaris Longus, Extensor Carpi Radialis, and extensor digitorium. This dataset provides valuable insights into the electromyographic activity associated with specific hand and wrist movements in a sample of ten healthy individuals, offering a foundation for studying neuromuscular patterns and facilitating advancements in human motion analysis and rehabilitation research.

The dataset contains data corresponding to 4 channels of delsys Trigno Electrodes. The connected electrodes were 3,4,5, and 7.

Channel 7 was placed on Flexor carpi ulnaris

Channel 5 was placed on Palmaris Longus

Channel 4 was placed on Extensor Carpi Radialis 

Channel 3 was placed on extensor digitorium

In the data structure:

CH corresponds to data for Close Hand

OH corresponds to data for open hand

EH corresponds to data for extend hand

FH corresponds to data for flex hand

R corresponds to data for rest
